COMP125 Assignment 2 for 2014 S2
================================

This repository holds the starter code for the second assignment in COMP125 at Macquarie University in S2 2014.

For this assignment you will write software to handle collections of GPS tracks of the kind that is 
generated by portable fitness trackers. A GPS track consists of a series of measurements of position. 
Your software will read these tracks and calculate summary statistics such as distance travelled and 
average speed. You will also write code to handle a collection of tracks for a user that will enable 
them to see their longest trips or those with the most elevation gain.

For full details see the PDF handout for the assignment.
